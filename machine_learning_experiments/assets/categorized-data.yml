# EthicalAds Topic Classifier Training Set
#
# This can be split into a test and train set with the following command:
#  > python scripts/generate-training-test-sets.py -o assets/train.json -f assets/test.json assets/categorized-data.yml
#
# Notes:
#  - the text is not pre-processed
#  - the URL is mostly just for data completeness
#  - each entry can have zero or more "topics"
